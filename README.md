There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Installed Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 and newer
- CLI with administrator privileges

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- pip

  ```sh
  pip install Flask
  ```

  ### Installation

  _Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

- Run your application using flask run.
  ```sh
  flask run
  ```
